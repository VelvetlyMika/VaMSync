# VAM Launch v2.0

## VAM Plugin that adds support for stroking/vibrating devices thru Buttplug.io

Download Latest: [v2.0](https://github.com/intiface/VaMSync/releases/)

### Version 2.0 Features

- Change name to VaMSync (as the launch is no longer a product)
- Update to Buttplug v1.x, including support for the [Kiiroo Keon](https://kiiroo.keon.buttplug.io) and [The Handy](https://thehandy.buttplug.io).
- Add capabilities to connect VaMSync to Intiface Desktop, meaning that even if this program isn't updated, it should still be able to connect to new toys.

### Version 1.0 Features

A HUGE thanks to [qdot](https://github.com/qdot) for collaborating with me to bring you:

#### • New LaunchServer GUI
[qdot](https://github.com/qdot) has implemented a fantastic GUI interface to
setup connections with all your devices.
No more ugly command line server!

#### • New Installer
The VAMLaunch now comes with an easy to use installer.

#### • New Motion Sources
There are new (and more reliable) ways to create device motion from within VAM, it really is possible now to achieve near 1:1 sync:

###### Oscillate Mode

[Instructions](Docs/OscilateMode.md)

Oscillate mode simply tells the device to move up and down at a certain speed, what makes this mode even more powerful is the ability to set an optional target AnimationPattern; VAMLaunch will take over this pattern and automatically adjust it's play time and speed to match the oscillation.

##### AnimationPattern Mode

[Instructions](Docs/AnimationPatternMode.md)

AnimationPattern mode works like oscillation mode but in reverse. Instead of an oscillation driving a motion and pattern, a target pattern is driving the motion directly.

#### • Influence Zone Mode (Experimental)

[Instructions](Docs/InfluenceZoneMode.md)

Influence Zone Mode: The original mode is still here with some additional quality of life improvements. Zone mode enables motion by analysing the motion of an atom within a zone of influence. This mode is the least accurate of the three modes, but it is the most adaptable.

#### • New trigger actions
You can now make it easier for users of your scene to control their device through three new triggers:
- startLaunch
- stopLaunch
- toggleLaunch


### Installation

Inside the .zip you will find two things:

- The VAMLaunch server installer: vamlaunch-installer.exe
- The VAM Plugin ("VAMLaunch" folder)

Start by running the installation program, you can install this to anywhere on your computer.

Once this is installed, copy the VAMLaunch plugin folder to this location:

YOUR_VAM_LOCATION/Saves/Scripts

### Making sure your Launch device is ready

I highly suggest following the instructions [here](https://github.com/FredTungsten/ScriptPlayer/wiki/Installation)
and testing your device with ScriptPlayer first to confirm you have everything
set up correctly.

If your device can connect to ScriptPlayer then it is highly likely it will work
with this plugin.

### Connect Your Device

Before running VAM you will want to connect your device to the VAMLaunch server.

Open the VAMLaunch server application (Which will now be located where you installed it)

<img src="Docs/Images/devices.PNG" width="300"/>

The application should start searching immediately when it opens, in the case of the Launch device make sure it is on with the blue light flashing.
Once connected the blue light on your device should become solid and you will be able to view your device in the list.
Simply tick the device to enable it.

You are now ready to start using VAMLaunch within VAM!

### Starting The Plugin

VAMLaunch can be loaded onto any Atom in VAM. Simply select an Atom (In this case we have created a sphere Atom)

Go to the Plugins tab and press "Add Plugin", select the ADD_ME.cslist file found in:

"YOUR_VAM_LOCATION/Saves/Scripts/VAMLaunch" (If you followed the above installing instructions)

### Plugin Menu

To open the plugin menu press "Open Custom UI" next to the VAMLaunch plugin in the list.

You will be shown this interface:

<img src="Docs/Images/options.PNG" width="400"/>

In the above image, the area marked in red contains the main options, and they will remain visible regardless of what mode VAMLaunch is in:

- "Pause Launch": By default your device should begin paused, simply untick this to begin sending messages to the device. (You can also use the "startLaunch", "stopLaunch" and "toggleLaunch" triggers to control this value from an in game button for example).
- "Simulator": This slider is moved automatically, its position represents a guess of how your real device will behave when interacting with VAM. This is very useful for fine tuning your scenes to get the most accurate motions out of the device.
- "Motion Source": Here you can select different motion sources for VAMLaunch, choosing one will change what is in this menu to Motion Source specific features.

The rest of the options are explained in the instructions for each Motion Source Mode:
- [Oscillate Mode](Docs/OscilateMode.md)
- [AnimationPattern Mode](Docs/AnimationPatternMode.md)
- [Influence Zone Mode](Docs/InfluenceZoneMode.md)
